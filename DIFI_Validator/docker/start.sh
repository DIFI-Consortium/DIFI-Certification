# To debug and test flask server running in 'application gateway' server option mode::
#
# 'curl' doesn't work, because curl sends 'http' protocol packets to the unix socket (/tmp/difi.sock) that is expecting 'uwsgi' protocol packets:
#   sudo curl -verbose --unix-socket /tmp/difi.sock http://10.1.1.1/api/v1/difi/help/api
#   (note: it does work if you change the uwsgi server start parameter from '--socket /tmp/difi.sock \' to '--http-socket /tmp/difi.sock \',
#   so it will change the underlying protocol from 'uwsgi' to 'http' protocol)
#
# 'uwsgi_curl' works, because sends 'uwsgi' protocol packets:
#   sudo pip install uwsgi-tools
#   sudo uwsgi_curl /tmp/difi.sock http://10.1.1.1/api/v1/difi/help/api
#   sudo pip uninstall uwsgi-tools
#
# 'socat' to listen to nginx calls sent from the browser to the uwsgi server, acting as though we're taking the place of the uwsgi server:
#   sudo apt install socat
#   sudo socat UNIX-LISTEN:/tmp/difi.sock,fork,reuseaddr,unlink-early,user=www-data,group=www-data,mode=777 -
#   sudo apt remove socat
#   (note: make sure to turn off uwsgi server running in docker container before starting socat, then run socat and call from browser)
